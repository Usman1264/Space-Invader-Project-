# Space-Invader-Project-
This game is my project that i built with my fellows. 
It is built using pure Programming Fundamentals and no use of classes or dynamic memory. 
The graphics library used in RAYLIB and much of the graphics work is done using it. 
It features a space shooting game with speacial power features and dynamics and also provides a high score file managment system.
